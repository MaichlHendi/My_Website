    <h2> <br> 2019 sep - 2019 okt<br>Machine operator <u> Scania</u> DMBSC2</h2>
    
    <p><br>
        I have had a workplace-based learning period for a week in Scania DM were i 
        got the opportunity to understand the concepts of a machine operator.
        The time i spent in the workplace was very short however it was very effective
        and i learnd the basics of how the workplace in Scania is organized and the key role
        a machine operator. With the help of my colleagues I operated a CNC lathe machine.

        
        </p>

         <h2><br>2020 nov - 2020 nov Machine operator/maintenance <u> AstraZeneca</u> PET FDI</h2>

         <p> <br>
        My time at AstraZeneca was a so called "winter job" in a period of 3 weeks. The 
        first two weeks I worked on a packaging line for the medecine Nexium. In AstraZeneca
        documentation is neccesery which lead to hourse of sorting and documenting in excel.
        The third week was with the maintenance team that meant problem solving and team work was 
        imortant to solve eventuell robotstops. Their was a stop in an ABB robotic arm and together with 
        a team we solved the problem.

            <p><br>
                A summer job for the period of 8 weeks in the new v6 cylinder head line.
                Newer lines take time to gain controll over and efficiate in order to produce in 
                high quality and quantity. With new prduction lines deviations in the 
                product is common however with our team we overcame obstacles and mett the requirements. 
                Later in the period i had responsebility to boot up the CNC machines by my self
                due to shortage in staf. 
            
            </p>

                 <p> <br>
                    This six weeks long workplace-based learning period was different to the others.
                    The main obective was to find a problem with in the production and 
                    solve the problem. I decided to chose a problem that lead to major economical
                    loses for Scania. I had to find a solution that is financially stingy and durable.
                    Unfortunatly the solution could not be implemented due to the small time margin.
                    I also wrote a project documentation for this problem and for further information 
                    about the project dont hesitate to contact me.

    <p><br>Before finishing highschool Scania contacted me to work in the new building
            "Nya Guteriet" as a full time job. I accepted the proposal and worked their 
            durring the summer in the section called formline. I worked with operating machines
            and performing quality checkes on the compresed forms that are later used to 
            create moter blocks and cylinder heads. This section is related to the summer job i hade in 
            DMAUC because the cylinder heads that were produced in "Nya Gjuteriet" were later shipped to
            section DMAUC for processing.

            <p>
                <br> <u> To the concerned </u><br>
                I am very 
                interested in technology therefore I have worked and studied in technology related environments
                such as Scania and KTH. This encourages me to apply for this job to get a chance of working again
                to expand my qualities and experiences where I get to know new people and share 
                my knowledge. Working as a team is very important to me, it has helped me a lot during my days. 
                Through cooperation, the company can develop and that helps with the 
                development of its personnel and professional processes. My hobbies are working out, playing 
                soccer and video games. I have various qualities that the company can benefit from,
                for example, I am very motivated and energetic during work and other important things. I can 
                tolerate a lot of stress and I usually handle problems very well by myself and in groups. 
                As a young upcoming engineer I have newer perspectives to solve modern problems and it is my 
                passion to develop newer technologies. A less good quality of mine is that I tend to lose 
                focus on things that are happening around me when I am working on a specific objective that 
                I strive for. This quality has its benefits and detriments. <br> <br> I hope my job application is used in
                an employment manner for further information please contact me, you can see my personal 
                information down below, <br> Thank you for your consideration.
