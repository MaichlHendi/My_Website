            <p>
                <br> <u> To the concerned </u><br>
                I am very 
                interested in technology therefore I have worked and studied in technology related environments
                such as Scania and KTH. This encourages me to apply for this job to get a chance of working again
                to expand my qualities and experiences where I get to know new people and share 
                my knowledge. Working as a team is very important to me, it has helped me a lot during my days. 
                Through cooperation, the company can develop and that helps with the 
                development of its personnel and professional processes. My hobbies are working out, playing 
                soccer and video games. I have various qualities that the company can benefit from,
                for example, I am very motivated and energetic during work and other important things. I can 
                tolerate a lot of stress and I usually handle problems very well by myself and in groups. 
                As a young upcoming engineer I have newer perspectives to solve modern problems and it is my 
                passion to develop newer technologies. A less good quality of mine is that I tend to lose 
                focus on things that are happening around me when I am working on a specific objective that 
                I strive for. This quality has its benefits and detriments. <br> <br> I hope my job application is used in
                an employment manner for further information please contact me, you can see my personal 
                information down below, <br> Thank you for your consideration.
